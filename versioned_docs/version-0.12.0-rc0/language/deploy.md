# Deploy Grammar

## Rule Deploy

### Deployment Language Entrypoint

This is the top level rule of the tremor deployment language `troy`



<img src="./svg/deploy.svg" alt="Deploy" width="713" height="100"/>

```ebnf
rule Deploy ::=
    ConfigDirectives ModComment DeployStmts  '<end-of-stream>' ?  
  | ModComment DeployStmts  '<end-of-stream>' ?  
  ;

```



## Rule ConfigDirectives

The `ConfigDirectives` rule allows line delimited compiler, interpreter or
runtime hints to be specified.




<img src="./svg/configdirectives.svg" alt="ConfigDirectives" width="421" height="75"/>

```ebnf
rule ConfigDirectives ::=
    ConfigDirective ConfigDirectives 
  | ConfigDirective 
  ;

```



## Rule ModComment

The `ModComment` rule specifies module comments in tremor.

Documentation comments for modules are optional.

A module documentation comment begins with a `###` triple-hash and they are line delimited.

Muliple successive comments are coalesced together to form a complete comment.

The content of a module documentation comment is markdown syntax.



<img src="./svg/modcomment.svg" alt="ModComment" width="231" height="55"/>

```ebnf
rule ModComment ::=
    ( ModComment_ ) ?  
  ;

```



### Example

Module level comments are used throughput the tremor standard library
and used as part of our document generation process.

Here is a modified snippet from the standard library to illustrate

```tremor
### The tremor language standard library it provides the following modules:
###
### * [array](std/array.md) - functions to deal with arrays (`[]`)
### * [base64](std/base64.md) - functions for base64 en and decoding
### * [binary](std/base64.md) - functions to deal with binary data (`<< 1, 2, 3 >>`)
### * [float](std/float.md) - functions to deal with floating point numbers
### * [integer](std/integer.md) - functions to deal with integer numbers
### * [json](std/json.md) - functions to deal with JSON
...
```



## Rule DeployStmts

The `DeployStmts` rule defines the statements that are legal in a deployment
module.

Statements in a deployment modules are `;` semi-colon delimited.

There MUST be at least one.

There MAY be more than one.



<img src="./svg/deploystmts.svg" alt="DeployStmts" width="395" height="87"/>

```ebnf
rule DeployStmts ::=
    DeployStmt  ';' DeployStmts 
  | DeployStmt  ';' ?  
  ;

```



## Rule DeployStmt

The `DeployStmt` rule constrains the statements that are legal in a `.troy` deployment module.

Importing modules via the `use` clause is allowed.

Flow definitions and `deploy` commands are allowed.



<img src="./svg/deploystmt.svg" alt="DeployStmt" width="255" height="108"/>

```ebnf
rule DeployStmt ::=
    DefineFlow 
  | DeployFlowStmt 
  | Use 
  ;

```



## Rule DefineFlow

<img src="./svg/defineflow.svg" alt="DefineFlow" width="809" height="42"/>

```ebnf
rule DefineFlow ::=
    DocComment  'define'  'flow' Ident DefinitionArgs  'flow' FlowStmts  'end' 
  ;

```



## Rule DeployFlowStmt

<img src="./svg/deployflowstmt.svg" alt="DeployFlowStmt" width="827" height="75"/>

```ebnf
rule DeployFlowStmt ::=
    DocComment  'deploy'  'flow' Ident  'from' ModularTarget CreationWithEnd 
  | DocComment  'deploy'  'flow' Ident CreationWithEnd 
  ;

```



## Rule Use

Imports definitions from an external source for use in the current source file.

The contents of a source file form a module.

### TREMOR_PATH

The `TREMOR_PATH` environment path variable is a `:` delimited set of paths.

Each path is an absolute or relative path to a directory.

When using relative paths - these are relative to the working directory where the
`tremor` executable is executed from.

The tremor standard library MUST be added to the path to be accessible to scripts.



<img src="./svg/use.svg" alt="Use" width="449" height="75"/>

```ebnf
rule Use ::=
     'use' ModularTarget 
  |  'use' ModularTarget  'as' Ident 
  ;

```



### Modules

Modules can be scripts. Scripts can store function and constant definitions.

Scripts are stored in `.tremor` files.

Modules can be queries. Queries can store window, pipeline, script and operator definitions.

Scripts are stored in `.trickle` files.

Modules can be deployments. Deployments can store connector, pipeline and flow definitions.

Deployments are stored in `.troy` files.

#### Conditioning

Modules in tremor are resolved via the `TREMOR_PATH` environment variable. The variable can
refer to multiple directory paths, each separated by a `:` colon. The relative directory
structure and base file name of the source file form the relative module path.

### Constraints

It is not recommended to have overlapping or shared directories across the set of paths
provided in the tremor path.

It is not recommended to have multiple definitions mapping to the same identifier.



## Rule DocComment

The `DocComment` rule specifies documentation comments in tremor.

Documentation comments are optional.

A documentation comment begins with a `##` double-hash and they are line delimited.

Muliple successive comments are coalesced together to form a complete comment.

The content of a documentation comment is markdown syntax.



<img src="./svg/doccomment.svg" alt="DocComment" width="231" height="55"/>

```ebnf
rule DocComment ::=
    ( DocComment_ ) ?  
  ;

```



## Rule Ident

An `Ident` is an identifier - a user defined name for a tremor value.



<img src="./svg/ident.svg" alt="Ident" width="167" height="42"/>

```ebnf
rule Ident ::=
     '<ident>' 
  ;

```




### Examples of identifiers

```tremor
let snot = { "snot": "badger" };
```

### Keyword escaping

Surrounding an identifier with a tick '`' allows keywords in tremor's DSLs to be
escaped

```tremor
let `let` = 1234.5;
```

### Emoji

You can even use emoji as identifiers via the escaping mechanism.

```tremor
let `ðŸš€` = "rocket";
```

But we cannot think of any good reason to do so!



## Rule ModularTarget

A `ModularTarget` indexes into tremor's module path.

In tremor a `module` is a file on the file system.

A `module` is also a unit of compilation.

A `ModularTarget` is a `::` double-colon delimited set of identifiers.

Leading `::` are not supported in a modular target..

Trailing `::` are not supported in a modular target.



<img src="./svg/modulartarget.svg" alt="ModularTarget" width="331" height="75"/>

```ebnf
rule ModularTarget ::=
    Ident 
  | ModPath  '::' Ident 
  ;

```



### Examples

#### Loading and using a builtin function
```tremor
# Load the base64 utilities
use std::base64;

# Base64 encode the current `event`.
base64::encode(event)
```

#### Loading and using a builtin function with an alias

```tremor
# Load the base64 utilities
use std::base64 as snot;

# Base64 encode the current `event`.
snot::encode(event)
```



## Rule CreationWithEnd

The `CreationWithEnd` rule defines a `with` block of expressions with a terminal `end` keyword.



<img src="./svg/creationwithend.svg" alt="CreationWithEnd" width="247" height="64"/>

```ebnf
rule CreationWithEnd ::=
    WithEndClause 
  | 
  ;

```



## Rule ConnectorKind

The `ConnectorKind` rule identifies a builtin connector in tremor.

Connectors in tremor are provided by the runtime and builtin. They can be resolved
through an identifier. 

### Examples

The `http_server` identifies a HTTP server connector.

The `metronome` identifies a periodic metronome.



<img src="./svg/connectorkind.svg" alt="ConnectorKind" width="135" height="42"/>

```ebnf
rule ConnectorKind ::=
    Ident 
  ;

```



## Rule FlowStmts

<img src="./svg/flowstmts.svg" alt="FlowStmts" width="175" height="42"/>

```ebnf
rule FlowStmts ::=
    FlowStmts_ 
  ;

```



## Rule FlowStmts_

  |  'connect'  '/' ConnectFromPipeline  'to'  '/' ConnectToConnector 
  |  'connect'  '/' ConnectFromPipeline  'to'  '/' ConnectToPipeline 
  ;

```



## Rule DefinePipeline

The `DefinePipeline` rule creates a named pipeline.

A pipeline is a query operation composed using the query langauge DSL
instead of a builtin operation provided by tremor written in the rust
programming language.

The named pipeline can be parameterized and instanciated via the `CreatePipeline` rule



<img src="./svg/definepipeline.svg" alt="DefinePipeline" width="1077" height="55"/>

```ebnf
rule DefinePipeline ::=
    DocComment  'define'  'pipeline' Ident (  'from' Ports ) ?  (  'into' Ports ) ?  DefinitionArgs Pipeline 
  ;

```



## Rule DefineConnector

The `DefineConnector` rule defines a connector.

A connector is a runtime artefact that allows tremor to connect to the outside
world, or for the outside connector to connect to tremor to send and/or receive
data.

The named connector can be parameterized and instanciated via the `Create` rule



<img src="./svg/defineconnector.svg" alt="DefineConnector" width="787" height="42"/>
