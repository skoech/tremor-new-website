### Example

Module-level comments are used throughout the Tremor standard library
and as part of our document generation process.

Here is a modified snippet from the standard library to illustrate this:

```tremor
### The Tremor language standard library provides the following modules:

### * [array](std/array.md)- functions dealing with arrays (`[]`),
