# Community

The Tremor project is an early-stage project, with a small supporting community.
As a recent open-source project, we have yet to evolve our community model based on community feedback.

However, we have adopted the [Rust Community](https://www.rust-lang.org/community) as a model for how we would like our community to evolve. To paraphrase our Rust friends, "Rust's greatest strength is the community of people who come together to make working in Rust a rewarding experience."

So, with a tip of the hat to our Rust friends:

> Tremor's greatest strength is the community of people who come together to make working with Tremor a rewarding experience.

## Get involved

The best way to get in involved to to join our [community discord](https://chat.tremor.rs). Say hello and meet the rest of the community.

You can also take a look at our code on [GitHub](https://github.com/tremor-rs) and brows through the different repositories we have.

And, if you want to stay up to date with what is going on you can follow us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/TremorDebs).

Lastly we do have community office hours and other events that we regularly hold and publish on your [CNCF Tremor Community](https://community.cncf.io/tremor-community/).

## Fork Now

For now, fork this web site on github or create an [issue](https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-www/issues) to get in touch while we figure out a better way!

## Events

From time to time, the tremor community engages with events and social media.

We report on previous [events](../community/events/overview) in our media log.
