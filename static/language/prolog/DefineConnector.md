The `DefineConnector` rule defines a connector.

A connector is a runtime artefact that allows Tremor to connect to the outside
world, or for the outside connector to connect to Tremor, to send and/or receive
data.

:::tip

The named connector can be parameterised and instanciated via the `Create` rule.
