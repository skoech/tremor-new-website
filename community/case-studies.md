# Case Studies

Until tremor was open sourced in February 2020, it was an internal project
designed for the needs of Wayfair's 24x7x365 infrastructure platform services
teams by a small group of developers based in Berlin and a large community of
SREs and infrastructure service providers based in Boston.

## Wayfair: Founding adopter

Wayfair has many tremor-based systems serving a wide variety of use cases. We
have documented the primary use cases with our partners in the Wayfair Technology
Organization.

Without the Infrastructure group, the Platform Engineering organization, the
Developer Platforms team and the wider Wayfair Technology organization tremor
wouldn't have been developed.

These use cases are battle hardened and they would be good uses for tremor
in your environment today.

## Call for Papers

We are now collecting and publishing adoption, collaboration and other tremor
adoption use cases from the wider tremor community. If you have an interesting
application of tremor in your systems and you think the techniques are useful
to the wider community, we would **love** to publish your experiences here for
the wider benefit of the community.
