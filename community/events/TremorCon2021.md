# TremorCon

TremorCon is an annual one-day conference that showcases the contributions
of Tremor mentees. We held the first [TremorCon](https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-tremor-community-presents-tremor-con-2021/) in 2021, and it was a great success;
so we have made it an annual event.

Here are the amazing talks from some of the mentees from our very first [LFX Mentorship](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/#projects_all) cohort as well as other members of the Tremor community, and a chat with the team!:
