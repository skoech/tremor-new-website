# The AWS `s3` Connector

The Amazon Web Services `s3` provides integration with the AWS Simple Storage Service or
drop-in compatible replacements such as [MinIO](https://www.min.io).

## Configuration

The following examples used a `MinIO` docker image which can be launched as follows:

```bash
$ docker run \
  -p 9000:9000 \
  -p 9001:9001 \
  -e "MINIO_REGION=eu-central-1" \
  -e "MINIO_ROOT_USER=SNOTIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE" \
  -e "MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=wJBadger/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY" \
  quay.io/minio/minio server /data --console-address ":9001"
```

### Reader

```troy
  # File: config.troy
  define connector s3_reader from s3_reader
  with
    codec = "json",
    preprocessors = ["lines"],
    postprocessors = ["lines"],
    config = {
      # The name of the AWS region to connect to
      "aws_region":  "eu-central-1",

      # The S3 or compatible URL endpoint
      "endpoint": "",

      # The name of the S3 bucket for this connector
      "bucket": "",

      # optional - The chunk size for multi-part related uploads/downloads
      # Defaults to 8MB
      # multipart_chunksize: 16 * 1024 * 1024,

      # optional - The size threshold over which multipart-related uploads/downloads kicks in
      multipart_threshold: 16 * 1024 * 1024,

      # optional - The maximum number of in-flight concurrent connections
      # Defaults to 10 connections
      max_connections: 1,
    },
  end;
```

### Writer

```troy
  # File: config.troy
  define connector s3_writer from s3-writer
  with
    codec = "json",
    preprocessors = ["lines"],
    postprocessors = ["lines"],
    config = {
      # The name of the AWS region to connect to
      "aws_region":  "<region-name>",

      # The S3 or compatible URL endpoint
      "endpoint": "localhost:9000",

      # The name of the S3 bucket for this connector
      "bucket": "snot",

      # optional - The minimum size for multipart-related
      # Defaults to 5MB ( must be no less than )
      # min_part_size : 10 * 1024 * 1024,
    },
  end;
```

## A MinIO storage service

In this example a JSON line-delimited file's content are replayed to a Minio Service mimicking AWS S3.

```troy
define flow main
flow  
  use troy::connectors;
  use integration;

  define connector out_s3 from s3-writer
  with
    codec = "json",
    preprocessors = ["separate"],
    postprocessors = ["separate"],
    config = {
      # The name of the AWS region to connect to
      "aws_region":  "eu-central-1",

      # The S3 or compatible URL endpoint
      "endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:9000/",

      # The name of the S3 bucket for this connector - should already exist as WILL NOT be created
      "bucket": "snot",
    },
  end;

  define connector in_file from file
  with 
    codec = "json",
    preprocessors = ["separate"],
    config = {
      "path": "in.json",
      "mode": "read"
    },
  end;

#  define connector out_s3 from s3-reader
#  end;

  define connector out_file from file
  with 
    codec = "json",
    preprocessors = ["separate"],
    config = {
      "path": "out.json",
      "mode": "truncate"
    },
  end;

  define pipeline s3_store
  from in
  into out, exit
  pipeline
    define script set_s3_key
    script
      use tremor;
      # derive a unique s3 key for each `event`
      let $ = { "s3": { "key": "snot_#{tremor::system::ingest_ns()}" }};
      event
    end;

    create script set_s3_key from set_s3_key;

    select event from in where event != "exit" into set_s3_key;
    select event from set_s3_key into out;
    select {"exit": 0, "delay": 1 } from in where event == "exit" into exit;
  end;

  create connector in_file;
  create connector out_s3 from out_s3;
  create connector exit from connectors::exit;
  create pipeline main from s3_store;

  connect /connector/in_file to /pipeline/main;
  connect /pipeline/main to /connector/out_s3;
  connect /pipeline/main/exit to /connector/exit;
  
end;
deploy flow main;
```


## NOTES

Environment variables should be set according to the AWS [environment variable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html) - however, the access key, shared access key and region __MAY__ differ on Minio from AWS.

A bucket called `snot` will need to be available.

The region in Minio settings should be the same as configured in the server startup.
