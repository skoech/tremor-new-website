# Functions

Tremor provides access to a growing number of functions that allow
advanced data manipulation or access to additional information.

Functions are namespaced to make identification easier.

Tremor also supports user defined functions. There are a few
noteworthy restrictions:

1. Functions are pure / side effect free - you can not mutate `event`, `state`,
   or `$` inside of a function.
2. Functions have to return a value, as tremor-script is expression oriented.
3. Functions can only be defined once, even if they take different forms or
   arguments. Function overloading is not supported.
4. In matching functions, a `default` case is required.
5. Functions can call other functions but they have to be a priori defined. The order of definitions is significant.
6. Tail recursion is supported, and constrained to a maximum recursion depth. A recursion depth is imposed as tremor-script is designed to operate on infinite streams of data so indefinite blocking/recursion is not supportable by design.

Lets look at the types of functions we have.

## Standard functions

[Grammar](./reference/script.md#rule-fndefn)

Standard functions are the common user-defined functions. They take a given number of arguments, each with
a name.

Example:

```tremor
## This function adds two values together
fn add(a, b) with
  a + b
end
```

### Variable arguments

It is possible to use a variable number arguments by appending a final `...` ellipsis in a standard
function definition. The anonymous arguments will be provided via the `args` keyword.

### Recursion

Standard functions with a fixed arity, that is, without variable arguments, can be tail-recursive.

Tremor imposes a restriction in recursion depth. As tremor is an event processing system
it is not desirable to have long running functions that block events from being processed
through the system.

A function can recurse and call itself using the [`recur` statement](./reference/script.md#rule-recur).

Example:

```tremor
use std::array;

fn sum_(e, es) with
  let l = array::len(es);
  match l of
    case l when l > 0 => 
      let a = es[0];
      recur(e + es[0], es[1:l])
    default => e
  end
end;

fn sum(...) with
  sum_(0, args)
end
```

## Match functions

[Grammar](./reference/script.md#rule-fndefn)

Since matching and extracting are a core functionality for tremor matching on
function arguments is directly supported.

The same patterns that are used in `match` can be used in function cases
including extractors. If any extracting pattern is used and matches the function
argument will be replaced by the result of the extraction.

```tremor
## calculates the fibonaci sequence
fn fib_(a, b, n) of
  case (a, b, n) when n > 0 => recur(b, a + b, n - 1)
  default => a
end;

## calculates the fibonaci sequence
fn fib(n) with
  fib_(0, 1, n)
end;
```

## Intrinsic Functions


[Grammar](./reference/script.md#rule-intrinsic)

:::note

Intrinsic functions cannot be user-defined.

:::

Intrinsic functions represent builtin or pre-defined functions implemented in the rust programming
language that are a builtin component of the tremor project and are provided out of the box.

The [Standard library] documentation, for example, is generated from the documentation
provided in the [Tremor Standard library](https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime/tree/main/tremor-script/lib). The [Standard library] is primarily composed of intrinsic or bulitin
functions.
