We had the great pleasure of spending some time with the crowd of Rust & Tell today. At the meetup, we got the chance to share some of the stories of tremor and Event Processing Cartography. Long story short, if you're curious, the talk was [recorded](https://youtu.be/43KS_nCqiIM?t=1932), and we got [the slides](/slides/2020-03-31-RustAndTellBerlin-functions.pdf) right here!
