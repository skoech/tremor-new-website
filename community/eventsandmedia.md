# Events and Media

From time to time the Tremor team hosts, engages with or
participates in community events.

Notable historical events are available for reference through
this section of the website.

If you would like members of the Tremor community to speak at
your event, appear in your podcast or attend your conference
then please reach out to us via our [chat](https://chat.tremor.rs)
system and say hello!
