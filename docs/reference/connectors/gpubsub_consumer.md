# The `gpubsub_consumer` Connector

This connector allows consuming a Google PubSub queue.

## Configuration

The credentials must be provided in a JSON file. The path to the JSON file should be set as an environment variable called `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`

```tremor title="config.troy"
define connector gsub from gpubsub_consumer
with
    codec = "string",
    config = {
        "connect_timeout": 100000000, # optional - Connection timeout in nanoseconds, defaults to 1 second 
        "ack_deadline": 100000000, # optional - ACK deadline in nanoseconds, defaults to 10 seconds. PubSub will resend the message if it's not ACKed within this time
        "subscription_id": "projects/my_project/subscriptions/test-subscription-a", # required - ID of the subscription to use
        "endpoint": "https://us-east1-pubsub.googleapis.com" # optional - the endpoint for the PubSub API, defaults to https://pubsub.googleapis.com
    }
end;
```
