The `DefineScript` rule defines a named operator based on a Tremor script.

A script operator is a query operation composed using the scripting language
DSL rather than the built-in operators provided by Tremor, written in the
Rust programming language.

:::tip

The named script can be parameterised and instanciated via the `CreateScript` rule.
