title: Running Docusaurus
---

## Overview

As part of Tremor's web redesign project, we seek to use a framework that unifies all the content forms (www, docs, rfcs and courseware) under a single consolidated theme and design. After a lot of tests and deliberation, we have decided to go with Docusaurus which checked a lot of boxes for our project. You can check out the criteria we considered in our comparison of various frameworks of interest [here](https://github.com/skoech/framework-comparison).
