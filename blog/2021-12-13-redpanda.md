# Using Redpanda with Tremor

Like all good projects in the open source community, great collaborations start with ad hoc interactions.

![Redpanda Rocket](./media/redpanda-rocket.png)

A recent set of discussions between the Tremor maintainers and our community brought [Redpanda](https://redpanda.com/) to our attention.

Some of our community would like to replace their Kafka deployments with [Redpanda](https://redpanda.com/), a Kafka API-compatible streaming
data platform, to realize gains in performance and reduce their total cost of operations. . As we already have Kafka
connectivity, enabling this shouldn’t be too complex, right? Let’s find out.

## Context

We are always looking out for interesting technology, and recently we read a [very interesting article](https://vectorized.io/blog/wasm-architecture/) on the Redpanda
blog about using WASM as server-side filters for subscription. Being as excitable as we are, we obviously had to give
Redpanda a shot.

To our joy this turned out to be painless, Redpanda reuses the Kafka API so our existing connectors for Kafka work
out of the box — and as a bonus we could get rid of a whole bunch of docker-compose YAML dancing that we needed to
set up Zookeeper.

Alex Gallego, founder of Redpanda, reached out to us and we started experimenting with Tremor and Redpanda in this
repo: [github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-redpanda](https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-redpanda)

## Setting up Tremor and Redpanda

So, let’s get our hands dirty and actually connect Redpanda and tremor in a real-world project.

We have prepared a fully equipped workshop for this occasion. Give it a shot [here](https://www.tremor.rs/docs/0.11/recipes/redpanda_elastic_correlation/README)
if you are impatient.

Tremor can flexibly act as a Redpanda/Kafka consumer or producer, make use of auto-commit for offset management or manually commit
when events are completely handled by the tremor pipeline. Here we are configuring Tremor only committing offsets when events have been successfully handled.

```yaml
onramp:
  - id: redpanda-in
    type: kafka
    codec: json
    config:
      brokers:
        - redpanda:9092
      topics:
        - tremor
      group_id: redpanda_es_correlation
      retry_failed_events: false
      rdkafka_options:
        enable.auto.commit: false
```

This tremor application is reporting success or failure of ingesting the received events into elasticsearch via another Redpanda topic.
Configuring this is also straightforward, here we have a [Redpanda](https://redpanda.com/) consumer ready for copy-pasting:

```yaml
offramp:
  - id: redpanda-out
    type: kafka
    codec: json
    config:
      group_id: tremor-in
      brokers:
        - redpanda:9092
      topic: tremor
```

Here you go. A fully working setup for orchestrating document ingestion with [Redpanda](https://redpanda.com/) delivering the documents and receiving acknowledgements.
For more details check out this Redpanda [recipe](/docs/0.11/recipes/redpanda_elastic_correlation) on our website.

Tremor is designed to be robust when faced with high volumetric data streams. It comes with batteries included for traffic shaping,
QoS and data distribution. With those tremor can guarantee at-least-once message delivery. We try to reduce CPU and memory footprint
for a given workload and at the same time provide a “just works” experience for operators. And we think we found a soulmate project in [Redpanda](https://redpanda.com/).

And most importantly, it is working like a charm. In fact we just dropped in [Redpanda](https://redpanda.com/) and expected some hours of troubleshooting, but this hope
was cut short by a smooth transition:

```


Both in terms of operator friendliness and performance we root for [Redpanda](https://redpanda.com/).


We started using it in our integration test suite, so users can be 100% sure [Redpanda](https://redpanda.com/) connectivity just works.
