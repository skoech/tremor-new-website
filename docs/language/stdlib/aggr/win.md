# win

The win module contains functions for aggregating over the current active window in a
window of events. The functions can also be used in tilt frames where events emitting
from a window are chained across multiple window frames in sequence.
## Functions
### first()

Capture and return the first event that hits a window upon/after opening.

Returns `anything`

### last()

Capture and return the last event that hits a window upon/after opening.

Returns `anything`

### collect_flattened()

Captures all events in a window into an array of events.

In the case of tilt frames, flattens out any tilt frame sub-arrays

Returns a `[anything]`

### collect_nested()

Captures all events in a window into an array of events.

In the case of tilt frames, each frame is preserved as a nested array of arrays. For a tilt
frame of 3 windows, the inner-most leaf array contains events, and higher levels are arrays of
arrays.

Returns a `[..[..[anything]..]..]`
