# Tremor Basics

This guide will walk you through the tremor basics, it'll be a starting point to learn how to get
data into the system, work with this data and get it out again.

The example is completely synthetic and desiged to teach fundamentals but it can be used as a
starting point for more complex systems.

We will go through this guide in steps, each building on the previous one but each step being
a complete unit in itself - this will allow you to try and test at each step of the way, pause
and continue another time.

A runnable example configuration for each of the steps is available [here](__GIT__/..)
