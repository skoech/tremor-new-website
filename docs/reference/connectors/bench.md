# The `bench` Connector

:::info

This connector is not intended for production use, but for benchmarking Tremor itself, or Tremor with a specific workload.

:::

The `bench` connector enables controlled micro-benchmarking of tremor-based
applications. Benchmarks and micro-benchmarking are an important part of the
performance engineering practices of the tremor authors.

We maintain and publish [benchmark results](https://www.tremor.rs/benchmarks/) that are
published every time code is commited to the main [tremor runtime](https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime] git repository
using bare metal infrastructure provided by the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io) on [Equinix Metal](https://metal.equinix.com/)
where we host a simple [continuous benchmarking service](https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-benchmark) designed for this
purpose.

### Example

```troy
  # File: example.troy
  use std::time::nanos;
  define connector bench from bench
  with
    codec = "json",   	                  # Decode each line as a JSON document
    config = {
      "source": "in.json",                # Take the source data from `in.json` and turn each line into an event
      "interval": nanos::from_millis(1),  # Wait for 1ms between each event
      "iters": 1,                         # Iterate only once through the data in `in.json`
    }
  end;
```

## Operation

The `bench` connector consists of two parts. The *source* part for generating synthetical loads of events and the *sink* part, measuring how many events it got and the latency of each event.

The *source* part will load an emulated source of events from a (possibly `xz` compressed) file and load them into memory.
It is required to send the emitted events to the *sink* part via the `in` port of the same connector eventually.
The pipelines and connectors in between can be considered the system that is subject to the benchmark.


The *source* part is replaying its contents for the duration of the test, or until the number of configured test iterations has been
exceeded; whichever happens first. Once the test has been stopped a high dynamic range [HDR Histogram](http://hdrhistogram.org/)
is produced and printed to stdout. The histogram can be loaded into the web based [histogram plotting tool](http://hdrhistogram.github.io/HdrHistogram/plotFiles.html) for analysis.

Once the latency histogram and throughput measures have been emitted, the tremor runtime process is halted.


## How do I write a benchmark?

The most important part of writing a benchmark with the `bench` connector is that the *source* part
needs to be the source of events. Usually the *source* part emits events as fast as it possibly can, in order to see how much the whole system is actually able to handle inm the best case.

The *sink* part needs to receive the events eventually, otherwise the benchmark does not measure anything. In that case the `bench` connector can be used as a load generator.

A complete benchmark will define the `bench` connector as in the
configuration example above with a system under test defined in a deployment file. A full
example is provided for illustration.

```troy
# File: config.troy
define flow main
flow
  use troy::connectors;

  define connector bench from bench
  with
    codec = "json",
    config = {
      "source": "in.json",
      "stop_after_secs": 10,
      "warmup_secs": 2
    }
  end;
  create connector bench;

  define pipeline bench_me
  pipeline
    # this is just a dummy pipeline.
    # What we actually benchmark here is how much throughput the vanilla tremor runtime
    # without any application logic can achieve.
    select event from in into out;
  end;
  create pipeline bench_me;

  # send synthetical load of events to the pipeline
  connect /connector/bench to /pipeline/bench_me;
  # send events to the bench connector for measuring and reporting
  connect /pipeline/bench_me to /connector/bench;
end;

deploy flow main;
```

This is a test of the benchmark connector itself that is exercised as part of our CI system, it can be run
manually as follows:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime
$ cd tremor-runtime
$ cargo build --all --release # grab a coffee, this takes a while
$ cd tremor-cli/tests/integration/blaster # Piu piu!
$ export TREMOR_PATH=/path/to/tremor-runtime/tremor-script/lib
$ tremor test bench .
  Running `target/debug/tremor test bench -v temp/bench`

It is an error to attempt to run a benchmark ( any deployment using the `bench` connector )
via the regular server execution command in the `tremor` command line interface
