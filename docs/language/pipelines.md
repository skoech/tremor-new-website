# Pipelines

This section details the major concepts of Pipelines in Tremor.

Pipelines form a directed acyclic graph or **DAG** from input ports over [Operators] towards output ports. The edges of this graph are constructed from [Select] queries.

```mermaid
graph LR
IN([in]) -->|select| OP(operator) -->|select| OP2(operator) -->|select| OUT([out])
IN -->|select| OP2
OP2 -->|select| ERR([err])
```

At its core, Pipelines are defined using [Operators] and [Scripts] (a highly customizable operator) and [Select] queries for combining them into an executable graph that can process events. [Select] queries can filter, transform, route and group streams of events. Events can be aggregated into [Windows]. [Stream Definitions] can be used to perform more complex query graph algorithms, like branching, joining or interleaving.

The [Select] queries in a Pipeline consume and produce unstructured data. The Pipeline runtime does not impose schema based constraints on data flowing through the system, although accessing data that is not present produces runtime errors and thus a schema can by dynamically enforced by user-defined pipeline code.

## Definitions

As all other entities in Tremor, pipelines need to be defined and created. They can have [Arguments] and they can specify their input and output ports. [Connectors] and other Pipelines can be connected to those ports only. The default ports are:

* `in` as the single input port
* `out` as output port for regular events
* `err` for events signalling a processing error

The task of every pipeline is to route events from one of its input ports to one of its output ports (or to filter out and drop events explicitly).

Example:

```tremor
define pipeline my_fancy_pipeline
args
  required_argument,
  optional_argument = 42
from 
  in1, in2
into
  out, err, exhaust
pipeline
  select event from in1 where event.ok == true into out;
  select 
    event 
  from 
    in1 
  where 
    match event of 
      case %{ absent ok, error == args.required_argument } => true
      default => true
    end
  into 
    err;

  select event from in2 into exhaust;
end;
```

This pipeline can be represented as a graph like this:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
IN1([in1]) -->|event.ok == true| OUT([out])
IN1 -->|match event of ...| ERR([err])
IN2([in2]) -->|select| EXHAUST([exhaust])
```

Pipelines can be created inside a [Flow](../language/index.md#flows) using a [Create statement](#create-statements).


## Statements

The body of a pipeline is also called a **Query**. It consists of one or many [Statements](#statements) and is introduced with the `pipeline` keyword. Such a Query consists of zero or more [Config Directives](#config-directives) followed by one or many [Statements](#statements) separated by `;`.  A **Query** needs to contain at least one [Select] statement that defines the event flow graph and connects input and output port and operators. 

This directed acyclic graph or **DAG** of operators connected by [Select]s is compiled into a DAG of operator nodes and validated at compile time. At runtime, the resulting executable tremor pipeline is evaluated/interpreted.

#### Grammar

> ![query grammar](./reference/svg/query.svg)

Stmt: <a name="Stmt"></a>
> ![statement grammar](./reference/svg/stmt.svg)

Statements can be one of:

- [Select statements](#select-queries)
- [Stream definitions](#stream-definitions)
- [Window definitions](#window-definitions)
- [Operator definitions](#operator-definitions)
- [`script` Operator definitions](#script-definitions)
- [Embedded Pipeline Definitions](#pipeline-definitions)
- [Create statements](#create-statements)



### Stream Definitions

Stream definitions in Pipelines allow private intermediate streams to be named so that they can be used as the source or sinks in other continuous queries. At runtime they are represented as a passthrough operator that will be optimized out if possible, so there is nearly no runtime overhead in defining and using streams.

Streams have ports. Selecting `into` a stream will implicitly select it to the `in` port of the stream.
Selecting `from` a stream will implicitly select it from the `out` port of the stream. It is possible to reference a port on the stream explicitly by using the following syntax: `stream/port`.

Streams can be used for graph algorithms, like [branching, joining and interleaving](./common_patterns.md#branching).

#### Grammar

#### Example

```trickle
create stream passthrough;

select event from in into passthrough; # select default public 'in' port into passthrough
select event from passthrough into out; # select passthrough into default public 'out' port

# specifying the port explicitly
select event from in into passthrough/in;
select event from passthrough/err into err;
```

### Window Definitions

> ![window definition grammar](./reference/svg/definewindow.svg)

Tremor supports the definition of tumbling windows.

A tumbling window is a window configured with a fixed non-overlapping interval. The window aggregates events once opened, and continues aggregating until it closes. The window can emit synthetic events upon closing. The window reopens for its next cycle when it closes.

Support for sliding windows has not been implemented yet (it has an [open RFC](https://www.tremor.rs/rfc/accepted/sliding-window-mechanism) and it will be picked up for a future release).

#### Tumbling Windows

Tremor supports tumbling windows by number of events or by time.

General configuration Parameters:

* `max_groups`: maximum number of groups to maintain simultaneously in memory. Groups added beyond that number will be ignored. Per default, tremor does not impose any limit on the number of groups kept simultaneously.

Each select statement maintains the groups for the current windows in an in memory data-structure. This contains the group values as well as the aggregate states.
If your grouping values possibly have a very high cardinality it is possible to end up with runaway memory growth, as per default the group data structures won't be evicted as long asd they hold data.
To configure an upper bound on the number of groups that should be maintained simultaneously for a window, set `max_groups`.

A [Select] query using one or more windows is generating _new_ synthetic events, aggregated from the events feeded into it. Even if a window only consists of a single event, it needs to be considered a new event. The shape of the new event is determined by the [`select`](#select-queries) _Target Expression_. Those new events will have an empty metadata and the [origin uri](../reference/stdlib/tremor/origin) is pointing to the windowed [Select] query.

##### Windows based on number of events

Tumbling windows based on the number of events close when a certain number of events has been received.

Configuration Parameters:

- `size`: Number of events until this window closes and emits a downstream event.

The size increment for each event defaults to `1` but can be customized by the embedded script in the window definition.
This script needs to return an unsigned integer denoting the number of events to use for this event.
It is possible to ignore the current event by emitting `0`.

##### Windows Based on Time

Time based tumbling windows close when a certain duration has elapsed. The source for measuring the duration
is the `ingest` timestamp of the events flowing through by default. The provided embedded script can be used to customize the
source of time measurement. The embedded script must return a number representing a timestamp in nanoseconds.
This way windows using timestamps other than the event ingest time can be built.

Only windows using the event ingest timestamp can be closed when the time in `interval` is elapsed measured by wall-clock time
independent from event flow with a granularity of `100ms`. It is thus possible that empty windows are emitted. Windows using scripts to determine the window elapsed time are considered to deviate from wall clock time and will only close and emit when events flow through them.

Configuration Parameters:

- `interval`: Time interval in nanoseconds after which the window closes.

##### Windows Based on State

The most flexible windows are code or state based windows. Instead of being fixed on the timestamp
or a message cout it allows to express the window logic of closing and emitting in tremor-script.

This requires two parts:

1) the `state` section of the window defines the inital state, this is the same as `state` for the script operator.
2) the `script from tick` section defines the logic that is executed on the periodic ticks to ensure windows that don't get new events can be closed and emitted.

The result of the script and tick script can emit a `array` of two elements. The first element defines if the widow should emit. The second one if the value should be included in this window (before emitting) or included in the ne

#### Examples

For example a 15 second tumbling window based on the event ingest timestamp can be defined as follows

```trickle
use std::time::nanos;

define window fifteen_secs from tumbling
with
    interval = nanos::from_seconds(15),
end;
```

the same as state window would read:

```trickle
use std::time::nanos;
use tremor::system;

define window fifteen_secs from tumbling
state
  null
script
  match state of
      null =>
        let state = system::nanotime();
        false
      s when state - system::nanotime() > nanos::from_seconds(15) =>
        let state = system::nanotime();
        true
      _ =>
        false
  end
end
```

The same window can be defined using a timestamp that is extracted from the message instead of the ingest time:

```trickle
use std::time::nanos;

define window fifteen_secs from tumbling 
with
    interval = nanos::from_seconds(15),
script
    event.timestamp
end;
```

### Operator Definitions

Operators form the nodes in the [Flow] graph. They process events in various forms and are built in to the Tremor runtime. Use a [Script] for building a custom operator with your own event processing logic.

Operators need to be created from a definition using the `create` statement before they can be referenced in [Select] statements and thus be part of the Pipeline graph. This additional step allows us to provide [Arguments](./index.md#arguments) for operators to customize definitions upon creation.

See the [Operator Reference](../reference/operators) for a list of all supported operators.

#### Grammar

Operator Definition:
> ![operator definition grammar](./reference/svg/defineoperator.svg)

Operator Creation:

> ![create operator grammar](./reference/svg/createoperator.svg)


#### Example

```trickle
# create a bucketing operator
define operator kfc from grouper::bucket;

create operator kfc;

# ...

select event from categorize into kfc;
select event from kfc into out;
```

### Script Definitions

Scripts are custom pipeline [operators](#operator-definitions) with a special syntax. They allow users to define their custom event processing logic in Tremor code.

A script is interpreted and executed for each event that is sent to it. Inside a script the special [path](./expressions.md#paths) `event` is referring to the event payload, while `$` is referring to the event metadata (which is always a [record](./expressions.md#records)). 

Same as with all operators, scripts have ports. If a script encounters an error, an event describing the error is sent to the `err` port. Otherwise, events can be [emitted](./expressions.md#emit) to arbitrary ports.
The last expression in a script determines the event payload emitted to the `out` port. Alternatively, one can always manually [emit](./expressions.md#emit) events to arbitrary ports. An `emit` will always terminate the script.

For more details on writing scripts, please consult our [Scripts documentation](./scripts.md).

#### Grammar

Script Definition Grammar:
> ![script definition grammar](./reference/svg/definescript.svg)


Script Creation Grammar:
> ![create script grammar](./reference/svg/createscript.svg)

#### Example

```trickle
define operator kfc from grouper::bucket;

define script categorize
script
  # add some values to the event metadata
  # those are required by the `grouper::bucket` operator defined above
  let $rate = 1;
  let $class = event.`group`;

  # this is the last expression that will form the output event payload
  { "event": event, "rate": $rate, "class": $class };
end;

create script categorize;

# Stream ingested data into categorize script
select event from in into categorize;

create operator kfc;
# Stream scripted events into kfc bucket operator
select event from categorize into kfc;

# route script error events to the pipeline `err` port
select event from categorize/err into err;

# Stream bucketed events into out stream
select event from kfc into out;
```

### Pipeline Definitions

> ![Pipeline Definition](./reference/svg/definepipeline.svg)

> ![Pipeline Creation](./reference/svg/createpipeline.svg)

Pipelines can contain and reference other pipelines. Those need to be either defined inside the current pipeline or referenced from another module via [use](./reference/query.md#rule-use). 
Inline pipelines then need to be created in order to reference them in [Select] statements. It is possible to select `into` the input ports of a pipeline and to select `from` the pipelines output ports.

Example:

```
define pipeline container
pipeline

  define pipeline inner_defn
  from
    custom_in
  into
    custom_out, custom_err
  pipeline
    select event from custom_in where !event.error into custom_out;

    select event from custom_in where event.error into custom_err;
  end;

  create pipeline inner from inner_defn;

  select event from in into inner/custom_in;
  select event from inner/custom_out into out;
  select event from inner/custom_err into err;

end;
```

This pipeline will create a graph like this:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
subgraph inner
  custom_in([custom_in]) -->|!event.error| custom_out([custom_out])
  custom_in -->|event.error| custom_err([custom_err])
end
IN([in]) -->|select| custom_in
custom_out -->|select| OUT([out])
custom_err -->|select| ERR([err])
```

During pipeline compilation and optimization those pipelines will be inlined into the containing pipeline, at runtime the ports and operators of the inline pipeline will be part of the containing pipeline graph.
The above pipeline will be optimize to a graph similar to the following semantically equivalent graph. The pipeline has been inlined and was actually optimized away completely as we were just forwarding events.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
IN([in]) -->|!event.error| OUT([out])
IN -->|event.error| ERR([err])
```

### Create Statements

> ![Create Operator](./reference/svg/createoperator.svg)

> ![Create Script](./reference/svg/createscript.svg)

> ![Create Pipeline](./reference/svg/createpipeline.svg)

> ![Create Stream](./reference/svg/createstream.svg)

All entities in a pipeline need to be [defined and created](./index.md#define-and-create) before they can be used to form a pipeline graph.

The only exception is the [Window](#window-definitions), which don't need to be created, only referenced in a [Select].

## Select Queries

Select Grammar:
> ![select grammar](./reference/svg/operatorselect.svg)

The select query is a builtin operation that is the workhorse of Tremor pipelines. A select query describes from where to where an event should be routed (and under which conditions) and how it is transformed along the way. it is connecting two nodes of the pipeline graph, and it can do a lot more.

An example select operation configured to pass through data from a pipeline's default `in` port to a pipeline's default `out` port:

```trickle
select event from in into out;
```

### Execution Order

Events flow through a [Select] query in a certain order. Lets travel with an event step by step and learn what happens at which step.

This is the general overview:

```mermaid
flowchart LR

FROM([from]) --> WHERE(where) --> GROUP_BY(group by) --> WINDOW(window) --> TARGET(select) --> HAVING(having) --> INTO([into])
```

#### From clause

Events are coming in from the input port, operator or stream specified in the required `from` clause.

#### Where clause

Select operations can optionally filter ingested data with the specification of a [`where` clause](#where-clause). The clause forms a predicate check on the inbound events before any further processing takes place.
That means the `event` available to the [`where` clause](#where-clause) is the unprocessed inbound event from the input port (`in` in this case):

```trickle
select event from in where event.is_interesting into out;
```

The where clause expression is required to return a boolean value.

#### Group By and Windows

Select operations can be windowed by **applying** a [Window] by specifying the window names in brackets after the input stream, operator or port specified in the [`from` clause](#from-clause).

```trickle
define window fifteen_secs from tumbling
with
    interval = datetime::with_seconds(15),
end;

select 
  { "count": aggr::stats::count() } 
from 
  in[fifteen_secs] 
into 
  out 
having 
  event.count > 0;
```


In the above operation, we emit a synthetic count every fifteen seconds if at least one event has been witnessed during a 15 second window of time.

Windows emit new events which are an aggregation of the events feeded into them. Those new events will have an empty event metadata (accessible via `$`).
The same is true for the [origin uri](../reference/stdlib/tremor/origin), which will point to the windowed query, not the origin of any event feeded into the window.

To drag event metadata across a windowed query, it needs to be selected into the event payload:

```trickle
define window take_two from tumbling
with
    size = 2,
end;

select
  {
    "first": aggr::win::first($.kafka.key),
    "all_metas": aggr::win::collect_flattened($),
  }
from 
  in[take_two]
into 
  out;
```

It is possible to specify multiple windows, separated by comma. Those windows then form a tilt-frame. The first window will both emit a synthetic event when the window closes to flow further through the [Select] query and also merge the current window state into the next window. If the second window is based on `size` and emits when it received 2 events, it will emit a synthetic event when it received 2 events from the previous window, not when the whole [Select] query received two events. See our docs about [Aggregation](../concepts/aggregation.md) for more details.

##### Group By

Select operations can be grouped through defining a `group by` clause.

```trickle
use std::time::nanos;

define window fifteen_secs from tumbling
with
    interval = nanos::from_seconds(15),
end;

select 
  { "count": aggr::stats::count() }
from 
  in[fifteen_secs]
group by 
  set(event.partition)
into 
  out
having 
  event.count > 0;
```

In the above operation, we partition the input events into groups defined by a required `event.partition` data field on the inbound event. Each of these groups maintains an independent fifteen second tumbling window. And each window, upon closing, generates an outbound synthetic event which is gated by a having clause checking the count for that group.

The current implementation of `select` allows [set-based](#SetBasedGroup) and [each-based](#EachBasedGroup) grouping. These can be composed concatenatively. However `cube` and `rollup` based grouping dimensions are not currently supported.

Using the `group by` clause in [Select] queries without a window will not aggregate any events but simply execute the [Target expression](#target-expression) with the current event and emit immediately. The special [`group` path](./expressions.md#reserved-paths) will be available.

In windowed queries any event related data (`event`, `$`, ...) can only be referenced in those two cases:

* it is used as an argument to an aggregate function
* it is used as expression in the `group by` clause

Here is an example of good and bad references:

```trickle
define window my_window from tumbling
with
  size = 12
end;

select 
  {
    "last": aggr::win::last(event.other), # ok, inside aggregate function
    "foo": event.foo + 1,                 # ok, expression is used in the `group by` clause
    "bad": event.other,                   # NOT OK
    "bad_meta": $my_meta,                 # NOT OK, same rules apply to event metadata
  } 
from 
  in[my_window]
group 
  by set(event.foo, event.bar)
into 
  out;
```

#### Target Expression

The _Target Expression_ of a select query is what comes right after the `select` keyword. It is used to describe transformations of the event. To pass through the event without changes, use `select event`, otherwise you can construct arbitrary [literals](./scripts#literals) (numbers, records, arrays, ...), call functions, aggregate functions, reference the event metadata via `$` or other [path expressions](./scripts#paths). Nearly everything is possible:

```trickle
use std::string;
use tremor::system;

select
  {
      "accumulated": [event.first, "middle", event.last],
      "metadata": $meta.nested[0].deep,
      "shouted": "#{ string::uppercase(event.message) }!",
      "now": system::nanotime(),
      "awesome": true
  }
from in into out;
```


#### Having 

Select operations can filter data being forwarded to other operators with the specification of a `having` clause. The clause forms a predicate check on outbound synthetic events after any other processing has taken place.
That means the `event` available to the `having` clause is the result of evaluating the `select` target clause (the expression between `select` and `from`).

```trickle
select event from in into out having event.is_interesting;
```

#### Into

Finally the required `into` clause determines where to send the resulting event generated in the [Target expression](#select). It can specify a stream (with port), an operator (with port) or a pipeline output port.

Examples:

```trickle
# ... 
create operator my_operator;

# selecting into an operator (its `in` port)
select event from in into my_operator/in;

# selecting into a stream
create stream river;

# selecting into the `spring` port of the `river` stream
select event from my_operator/out into river/spring;

# selecting into a pipeline output port
select event from in into out;
```

## Config Directives

Config directives can be used to customize metadata of a pipeline.

Its syntax is the following:

```
#!config <id> = <expr>
```

Example:

```tremor
define pipeline foo
pipeline
  #!config metrics_interval_s = 5
  select event from in into out;
end;
```

### `metrics_interval_s`

The only supported config directive is `metrics_interval_s` for enabling the production of pipeline metrics data and the interval (in seconds) in which to emit metrics events to the [Metrics Connector](../reference/connectors/metrics.md).
