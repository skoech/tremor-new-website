The `DefinePipeline` rule creates a named pipeline.

A pipeline is a query operation composed using the query langauge DSL
instead of a built-in operation provided by Tremor, written in the Rust
programming language.

:::tip

The named pipeline can be parameterised and instanciated via the `CreatePipeline` rule.
