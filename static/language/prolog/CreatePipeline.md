The `CreatePipeline` rule creates a pipeline.

A pipeline is a query operation composed using the query langauge, DSL,
instead of a built-in operation provided by Tremor, written in the Rust
programming language.

The rule causes an instance of the referenced pipeline definition to be
created and inserted into the query processing execution graph.
